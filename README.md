# pomodoro-timer
a simple pomodoro timer using html, css and javascript

Inspiration

A pomodoro cycle consists of intense working for 25 minutes, followed by a five minute break. It has been proven to be an effective way to increase productivity.
I have attempted to replicate this in a website format, so that the user can use the timer as they work on their laptops.

How to use

To use, click on the start button to start the timer. An alarm will go off after 25 minutes. It is recommended to take a break of 5 minutes
after each work session. 

Future Prospects 

This is the most basic version of the pomodoro technique. I plan to add on more functionalities such as giving the user the option to change the timings of the work and break cycle, or adding options to play ambient white noise as you work.
